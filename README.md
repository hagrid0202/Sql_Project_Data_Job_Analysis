# Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

``` SQL
-- Top 10 Highest Paying Data Analyst Positions Along With Company Name.
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title_short,
    job_location,
    salary_year_avg,
    name
FROM
    job_postings_fact LEFT JOIN company_dim ON
    company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
